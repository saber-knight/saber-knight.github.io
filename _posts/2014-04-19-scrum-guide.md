There are 2 common methodology in software development, which are **waterfall** model and **scrum**.

Waterfall model is a traditional developing model, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards through the phase of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Implementation, and Maintenance. This model is based on the experience summarized from traditional industry society that the work flow need to be sequential, which means something must be done beforehand then we could start the others. However, though waterfall model is doing well in some industrial enterprises, it is not one hundred percent suitable for the IT company, especially in the 21 century.

There are too many changes happened nowadays, not only the customers' requirements, but also the technology, the business market, and the future direction of the company. Within the waterfall model, everything is decided so that change is not a good thing. But in order to adapt the new circumstance, we need to find out a new method to deal with numerous, inevitable changes.

Scrum is a new working methodology now using by many successful IT companies. It is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing software projects and product or application development.

The theory of scrum is from empiricism which means knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. There are 3 pillars of empiricism which are Transparency, Inspection, and Adaption. Through transparency, every member of the project can have a clear understanding of what is going on within the project. When everyone is well-informed, it can obviously reduce the occurrence of conflicts because most of misunderstanding and miscommunication happened from different standard and knowledge background. Through inspection, we review our works and try to find out what is doing well and what is not. After that, solving problems and improving ourselves by adapting those experience into next sprint.

Scrum Team is formed by product owner, development team and scrum master. The product owner are responsible for managing the product backlog and ordering different items within the product backlog. For the development team, scrum has a high standard for them. All development team members need to self-organizing, cross-functional and accountable for the whole development team. The scrum master ensures scrum is understood by everyone and enacted correctly.

Scrum divides one large project into many sprints. Usually one sprint lasts for 3-4 weeks, and within one sprint there are 4 parts which are scrum planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.

###Scrum planning
Scrum planning defines what can be done this sprint and how will the chosen work get done.

###Daily scrum
Daily scrum is a 15 mins daily meeting which discusses about what did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team to meet the sprint goal and what will I do today to help the Development Team to meet the sprint goal. And if there are any impediments happened, try to solve it during the daily scrum.

###Sprint Review
Sprint review is usually a 4 hours meeting for a 1 month sprint after the sprint ends. All project members need to attend it. The product manager explains what product backlog items have been done and what has not been done. The development team discuss what went well during this sprint, what problems it ran into, and how these problems were solved. Then the development team demonstrate the work that it has done and answers questions from others. After reviewing what has been done, the product manager discuss about the current product backlog and the whole progress of the project. When everyone is informed about this sprint and the whole project, then it's the time to talk about what to do next. Lastly, discuss about the market and technology, whether there are some changes happened from the outside world. If it is, adapting the good things and move on.

###Sprint Retrospective
Sprint review is not the end of one sprint, sprint retrospective provide another chance for the project team to review the people, the relationship, the process and the tool within last sprint. Can we do our work better? That is the real purpose of sprint retrospective. There are no perfect process and result so that we need to improve continuously. Moreover, implementing those improvements to the way the scrum team does its work during next sprint.

Scrum is not only a methodology, it is a higher standard for everyone within the product team. It has no doubt that scrum will enhance the efficiency but the premise is everyone's behavior is followed by the scrum rules. The secret of successful work is making people better, not managing people better.
