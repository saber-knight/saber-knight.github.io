title: 42 Tips for Good UI
---

1. Try a 1 column layout instead of multi-columns. A one column layout guide your readers in a more predictable way from top to bottom. Whereas a multi-column approach runs some additional risk of being distracting to the core purpose of a page. Guide people with a story and a prominent call to action in the end.

2. Try giving a gift instead of closing a sale right away. Gifting is also an effective persuasion tactic that is based on the rule of reciprocity.

3. Try merging similar functions instead of fragmenting the UI. The more UI fragmentation there is, the higher learning curve which your customers will have to deal with. Consider refactoring your UI once in a while by merging similar functions together.

4. Try social proof instead of talking about yourself. 

5. Try a testimonial or showing data which proves that others are present.

6. Try repeating your primary action instead of showing it just once. Repeating your call to action is a strategy that is more applicable to longer pages, or repeating across numerous pages.

7. Try distinct clickable/selected styles instead of blurring them. Visual styling such as color, depth, and contrast may be used as a reliable cue to help people understand the fundamental language of navigating your interface: where am I, where can I go.

8. Try recommending instead of showing equal choices. When showing multiple offers, then an emphasized product suggestion might be a good idea as people need a little nudge.

9. Try undos instead of prompting for confirmation. Most of the time human actions are intended and only in small situations are they accidental. The inefficiency and ugliness of prompts is visible when users have to perform actions repeatedly and are prompted numerously over and over - a dehumanizing experience.

10. Try telling who it's for instead of targeting everyone. By communicating the qualifying criteria of your customers, you might be able to actually connect more with them while at the same time hinting at a feeling of exclusivity.

11. Try being direct instead of indecisive. Maybe there is a bit more room for telling people what to do next in the world of conversion optimization.

12. Try more contrast instead of similarity with primary calls. Making your calls to action be a bit more prominent and distinguishable in relation to the elements surrounding them, will make your UI stronger.

13. Try showing where it's made instead of being generic. Stating where your product is being made at also has a pretty good chance of making it feel of slightly higher quality. It's a win win.

14. Try fewer form fields instead of asking for too many. Human beings are inherently resistant to labor intensive tasks and this same idea also applies to filling out of form fields.

15. Try exposing options instead of hiding them. Can we show all options in one page instead of hiding them in a pull down menu?
Try suggesting continuity instead of false bottom. Be careful of giving your visitors a sense that the page has come to an end somewhere in between sections where it really hasn't.

16. Try keeping focus instead of drowning with links. Keep an eye out on the number of links on your pages and possibly balance discovery style pages with tunnel style pages. Removing extraneous links can be a sure way to increase someone's chances of reaching the important button.

17. Try showing state instead of being state agnostic. Interface states can help people understand whether or not their past actions have been successfully carried out, as well as whether an action should be taken.

18. Try benefit buttons instead of just task based ones. Reinforce a benefit might lead to higher conversions.

19. Try direct manipulation instead of contextless menus. It makes sense to allow certain UI elements to be acted upon directly as opposed to listing unassociated generic actions.

20. Try exposing fields instead of creating extra pages. Cutting out extra steps from the flow in general and the task at hand takes less time.
